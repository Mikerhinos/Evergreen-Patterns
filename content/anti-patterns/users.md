# Description

Users will use the system you build and design in ways you have never envisionned. It can have several reasons. Maybe they were not trained adequatly or maybe they are just very creative.

## Some typical examples
Administrators of the application will configure access rights in a way that you didn't think was possible or even useful
Users will sometimes double-click, triple click links when they are waiting for too long

# Key patterns that can mitigate this problem

- Chaos Engineering
- Bulkheads
